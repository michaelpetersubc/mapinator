On this dashboard we present geodetic plots that show the flows of Ph.D. graduates' placements. We sourced publically available data on the placements of Ph.D. graduates, including the institution where each applicant graduated from and the institution where they found a job. We added horizontal position representations (specifically latitudes and longitudes) to each of the institutions. It is worth noting that, in the summary charts below, we focus on institutions with economics departments ranked in the top 100 according to [rankings compiled by Tilburg University](https://econtop.uvt.nl/rankinglist.php) in 2016.

We organize the maps by three categories: institution where the appliant graduated from, type of position, and placement year. Notice that the dropdown allows you to select a basket of institutions for which you'd like the map to be generated. Below the map, the same data is presented as a table for convenience.

## Data Limitations

The limitations of the data include:
- Certain institutions do not publish placement lists with names. We are working on searching for these applicants through LinkedIn profiles, professional websites, and published resumes and curricula vitae. Thus, regression analyses may be susceptible to selection bias. Please refer to the barplots in the next section to learn more about the coverage of the data.
- Plots converging in the Gulf of Guinea at the intersection of the Equator and the Prime Meridian are institutions for which we currently do not have horizontal position representations.
- The population of graduates from institutions outside the United States, Canada, and Western Europe are underrepresented in the sample.
- Recruiter types are self reported by the institutions.
- There may be ambiguity in the assignment of positions. In particular, "Lecturers" at certain institutions - in particular European institutions - are indeed "Assistant Professors". Similarly, there are instances of ambiguity between "Post-Docs" and Visiting Assistant Professors, the latter of which are classified as "Visiting Professor/Lecturer/Instructor". Instructors and Assisant Professors of Teaching are classified as "Visiting Professor/Lecturer/Instructor", "Lecturer", or "Assistant Professor".
- Rankings are currently only assigned to a single department in an institution.
- Applicants whose department of academic placement is ambiguous, or not present in the database, have been assigned by default to the Economics department of said institution, if this department exists. If not, they have been assigned to the first listed department.
- For private institutions with multiple branches, the assignment of horizontal position representation does not necessarily accurately reflect branch of placement.
- Some applicants may have graduated from an institution where they were awarded an undergraduate or Master's degree rather than a Ph.D. While the vast majority of placements are of Ph.D. graduates, there may be some which are not, and these rare exceptions are not explicitly indicated in the sample at this time.
- Placements at multinational corporations may have inaccurate location information. Specifically, all branches of a particular private sector organization may not be present in the dataset.
- Select outcomes erroneously display the hiring institution as the institution an applicant graduated from. The number of outcomes displaying this behaviour is not known at this time.
- A small number of outcomes correspond to applicants who were hired as research or teaching assistants during their Ph.D. program as opposed to after.
- A small number of outcomes, the majority of which were placements prior to 2018, exist in the database more than once.
- A small number of outcomes from 2006 and years prior to 2005 may be misreported as being placed in a different year. Notably, many 2006 entries are reported as 2007, and some pre-2005 entries are reported as either 2005 or 2022.
